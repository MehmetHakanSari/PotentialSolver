# Foil Solver

This repository contains the source code for the Foil Sover project. Foil Sover is a web application that allows users to create and solve foil puzzles. Foil puzzles are a type of logic puzzle that are similar to Sudoku. The goal of the puzzle is to fill in the grid with numbers such that each row and column contains each number exactly once. The difference between Foil puzzles and Sudoku is that the numbers in each row and column are not necessarily consecutive. Foil puzzles are also known as Non-Consecutive Sudoku.
